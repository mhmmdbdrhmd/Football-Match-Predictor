<summary><strong>Overview</strong></summary>
<br>
This project leverages machine learning to predict sports event outcomes. By analyzing historical data, we develop and compare various models to forecast future match results accurately.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Data Collection and Preprocessing</strong></summary>
<br>
We collect data from several sports databases, focusing on team performance, player statistics, and match outcomes. Preprocessing includes cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for analysis.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Model Development and Evaluation</strong></summary>
<br>
The project evaluates multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The primary evaluation metric is accuracy.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Results</strong></summary>
<br>
Models are ranked based on their accuracy scores, with a detailed analysis of their performance in predicting sports outcomes. The document highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each model in the context of our dataset.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Future Directions</strong></summary>
<br>
Future work will explore the application of these models to real-world betting systems and fantasy sports, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability further.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Output Visualization</strong></summary>
<br>
Visualizations include accuracy comparison charts among different models, feature importance graphs, and prediction outcome visualizations.
